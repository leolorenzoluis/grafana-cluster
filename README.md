## Install

In order to add this block, head to your project directory in your terminal and add it using NPM.

```bash
npm install @aws-blocks/grafana-cluster
```

The stack will be available into the `node_modules/@aws-blocks` directory.

## Features

 - Serverless, scalable deployment of a Grafana cluster on AWS.
 - Load balancer and alerting mechanisms built-in.
 - Provision Grafana properties and plugins from the stack parameters.
 - Non-intrusive and can be seamlessly integrated into your own architecture.

## Description

This repository features a CloudFormation stack which creates a scalable Grafana cluster using Docker containers on AWS Fargate. You can either deploy it as a standalone stack using the AWS console or the AWS CLI, or integrate it as a sub-stack as part of your own deployment.

## Deployment

1. Start by installing this stack locally using `npm`.

2. Head to the `node_modules/@aws-blocks/grafana-cluster` in your shell and package the stack using the `aws-cli` so that the sub-stacks are bundled with the cloudformation template provided in this repository.

```bash
aws cloudformation package --s3-bucket <an-s3-bucket-you-own> --template-file cloudformation.yml --output-template-file cfn.package.yml
```

3. Once the stack is packaged, you can open the AWS Cloudformation console in your browser and select the **Create Stack** button. Select then the **Upload a template to S3** option and upload the **cfn.package.yml.yml** file that has been created.

4. At this point you can go to your [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) in your AWS account and deploy the `cfn.package.yml` file.

5. Configure the parameters to match your deployment requirements in the CloudFormation console when deploying your project. More information are available on the parameters made available by this stack in the below section.

6. Once your stack parameters are set click **Next** and **Next** again. On the last page, make sure that you select the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.** and the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might require the following capability: CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND** options before deploying, and once it is selected you can continue with deploying the stack.

## Block Parameters

Below is a description of the different parameters exposed by this Cloudformation stack. The parameters which do not have a default value must be explicitely specified.

Parameter | Description | Type | Default |
--------- | ----------- | ---- | --------
**Environment** | The environment name on which you would like to deploy the project. This identifier will be used to tag created resources. | String | development
**DatabaseInstanceType** | The database instance class to associate with the Aurora storage cluster. | String | db.r4.large
**DatabaseBackupRetentionPeriod** | The number of days for which automated backups are retained. | Number | 7
**EncryptionAtRest** | Indicates whether the Aurora database storage should be encrypted. | Boolean | false
**DatabaseSubnets** | The subnets to place database instances in, specify at least 2 subnets for the RDS database. | List of `AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id` | 
**DatabaseUser** | The database master account user name of the RDS database (this field cannot be equal to the `admin` identifier, as it is a reserved keyword). | String | 
**DatabasePassword** | The database master account password of the RDS database (choose a secure password with a length of at least 8 caracters). | String | 
**DatabaseName** | The name of the database to create and which will contain the data generated by the Grafana nodes. Choose a name of at least 5 caracters. | String |
**PreferredBackupWindow** | If automated backups are enabled (see the BackupRetentionPeriod property), the daily time range in UTC during which you want to create automated backups. | String | 01:00-02:30
**PreferredMaintenanceWindow** | The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur. | String | mon:03:00-mon:04:00
**CloudWatchDashboard** | Whether to create a Cloudwatch monitoring dashboard associated with the created Grafana cluster. | Boolean | false
**SessionStorageType** | (Redis only) - The session storage type for Grafana (stroging Grafana sessions in a distributed Redis is highly recommended). | String | redis
**CacheNodeType** | (Redis only) - The cache node instance class to deploy in the cluster. | String | cache.t2.micro
**CacheClusterSubnets** | (Redis only) - The subnets to place cache nodes in, specify at least 2 subnets for the caching nodes. | List of `AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id` | 
**AutomaticFailoverEnabled** | (Redis only) - Indicates whether Multi-AZ is enabled. When Multi-AZ is enabled, a read-only replica is automatically promoted to a read-write primary cluster if the existing primary cluster fails. | Boolean | true
**NumNodeGroups** | (Redis only) - The number of node groups (shards) for this Redis replication group. | Number | 1
**ReplicasPerNodeGroup** | (Redis only) - The number of replica nodes in each node group (shard). | Number | 2
**AtRestEncryptionEnabled** | (Redis only) - Indicates whether to enable encryption at rest on the ElastiCache cluster. | Boolean | false
**TransitEncryptionEnabled** | (Redis only) - Indicates whether to enable in-transit encryption on the ElastiCache cluster. | Boolean | false
**RedisCloudWatchDashboard** | (Redis only) - Whether to create a Cloudwatch monitoring dashboard associated with the created ElastiCache cluster. | Boolean | false
**PublicSubnets** | The list of public subnets to associate with the internet facing load balancer, specify at least 2 public subnets. | List of `AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id` | 
**PrivateSubnets** | The list of private subnets to associate with the Grafana container deployments, specify at least 2 private subnets. | List of `AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id` |
**VpcId** | The VPC identifier to deploy the Grafana application in. | AWS::EC2::VPC::Id |
**SSLCertificateArn** | (Optional) - An ARN associated with a TLS certificate to use from Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM). | String |
